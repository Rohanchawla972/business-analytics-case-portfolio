# Zach’s Garage Case Study — Price Optimization Report  

## Project Objective  
This project analyzes **ticket pricing strategies** for Zach’s Garage, a community-driven concert venue in Chicago, facing a monthly operational deficit of ~$3,000. Using the **Gabor-Granger pricing model** and **Enginius Pricing Optimization**, the study evaluates potential ticket pricing schemes to balance **financial sustainability** with **community accessibility**.  

Key questions addressed include:  
- What ticket price maximizes expected monthly revenue?  
- At what price would attendance drop by half?  
- What is the break-even ticket price?  
- How do segmented pricing strategies (youth free/discounted entry) affect profit and attendance?  

---

## Methodology  
- **Survey Design**: Event attendees rated likelihood of attending at ticket prices ($1, $3, $5, $8, $12, $20).  
- **Model Used**: Gabor-Granger pricing analysis with **Enginius Pricing Optimization (Logit model)**.  
- **Market Size**: 3,000 monthly attendees (12 shows × 250 attendees each).  
- **Fixed Costs**: $3,000/month included in all simulations.  
- **Segmentation**: Analysis of **youth segment (≤21 years)** with free vs discounted pricing.

## Key Findings  
1. **Revenue Maximization**:  
   - Optimal flat price: **$3.31** → Revenue $4,768, Profit $1,768.  
2. **Attendance Sensitivity**:  
   - Attendance halves at ~**$3.00**, critical for understanding drop-off points.  
3. **Break-Even**:  
   - Minimum price: ~**$1.50** per ticket.  
4. **Youth Free Entry (≤21 years)**:  
   - Adults $3.57, youth free → Profit $659, Attendance 2,024 (higher reach, lower profit).  
5. **Youth Discounted Entry**:  
   - Adults $3.57, youth $2.60 → Profit $1,826 (highest), Attendance 1,474.

## Recommendations  
- Adopt **segmented pricing**: $3.57 for adults, $2.60 for youth.  
- Avoid free-entry for youth; a modest fee maintains inclusivity while boosting profit.  
- Keep flat pricing ($3.31) as a fallback option if segmentation is not feasible.  
- Use break-even pricing only as an emergency measure.
