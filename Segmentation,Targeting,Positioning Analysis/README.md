# Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning (STP) — Case Study

## Project Objective
This project analyzes the strategic challenges faced by **Power BA**, an Auckland-based boutique investment consultancy, in the post-COVID-19 investment environment. The objective is to recommend a **segmentation, targeting, and positioning (STP) strategy** that helps Power BA manage increased competition, shifting investor behavior, and growth opportunities.

The analysis addresses:
- Designing a **needs-based segmentation** scheme to group investors based on motivations, goals, and risk tolerance.
- Exploring variables for profiling segments and applying methods like **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** if a choice-based approach were used.
- Recommending a **targeting strategy** for high-value segments to maximize customer engagement and lifetime value.

## Key Insights
- **Segmentation**: Clients grouped as Safe Planners, Growth Seekers, Big Investors, and Comeback Clients, based on needs and motivations rather than past product choices:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- **Variables**: Base variables (risk tolerance, goals, time horizon) and descriptor variables (age, income, investor type, digital usage) ensure actionable segmentation:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- **Targeting**: Value-based prioritization of segments like Growth Seekers and Big Investors, while deploying win-back strategies for Comeback Clients:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
