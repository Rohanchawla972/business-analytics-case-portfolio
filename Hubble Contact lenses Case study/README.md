## 📊 Key Insights & Findings  
- **Aggressive Acquisition Strategy:** Hubble grew rapidly through online marketing campaigns, offering free trials and heavily discounted plans. While effective in onboarding customers, it significantly increased acquisition costs.  
- **High Churn Rates:** Monthly churn of ~4% posed a major challenge, reducing the effectiveness of their subscription model and impacting CLV.  
- **Unit Economics Under Pressure:** Heavy dependence on a single overseas supplier and thin profit margins limited scalability and exposed supply chain risks.  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Despite rapid growth, CLV was often not high enough to offset acquisition costs, highlighting sustainability risks.  
- **Competitive Risk:** Larger incumbents and regulatory scrutiny in the healthcare space posed significant threats to long-term viability.
