# Ford Hybrid Cars — Bass Diffusion Case Study

## Project Objective  
This case study applies the **Bass Diffusion Model** to forecast the adoption of hybrid vehicles in the U.S. and evaluate the feasibility of **Ford’s production target of 250,000 hybrids annually by 2010**.  
The goal is to analyze market adoption scenarios, assess risks of overcapacity, and recommend strategic actions for Ford.

---

## Business Context  
- In 2006, Ford reported record losses due to declining SUV/truck sales, high fuel prices, and rising competition from Toyota and Honda.  
- New fuel economy regulations (CAFE standards) pressured Ford to innovate.  
- CEO Alan Mulally committed to producing **250,000 hybrids annually by 2010**.  
- The key challenge: Could the hybrid market realistically support this production target?

---

## Methodology  
The **Bass Diffusion Model** was used to forecast U.S. hybrid adoption from **2007 to 2016**, with scenarios built in **Enginius**:  

- **Historical Data (2000–2006):** early adoption trends for hybrids.  
- **Analogies:** Diesel adoption in Europe, EFI, and ABS technology.  
- **Parameters:**  
  - *p (innovation coefficient)* — effect of marketing, advertising, promotions.  
  - *q (imitation coefficient)* — peer effects, word-of-mouth.  
- **Scenarios:** Pessimistic, Realistic, and Optimistic forecasts.

## Findings  

### 1. Pessimistic Scenario (Slow Adoption)  
- Very low advertising impact, high price sensitivity.  
- By 2016: ~2.7M hybrids adopted (~2.7% of market).  
- Ford’s 10% share ≈ **271K units total** by 2016.  
- Target of 250K **per year by 2010 not achievable**.  

### 2. Realistic Scenario (Base Case)  
- Balanced innovation and imitation effects.  
- By 2011: adoption reaches ~12% of market, steady S-curve growth.  
- Indicates **gradual acceptance** but still below Ford’s target capacity by 2010.  

### 3. Optimistic Scenario (Fast Adoption)  
- Strong marketing + consumer pull.  
- By 2016: ~14.8M hybrids adopted (significant penetration).  
- Even under this case, Ford’s 250K/year goal by 2010 is **too aggressive**.  

---

## Recommendations  
- Do **not commit blindly** to 250K/year by 2010.  
- Use a **phased production strategy** aligned with adoption trends.  
- Strengthen **marketing, partnerships, and financing schemes** to accelerate adoption.  
- Maintain an **adaptive strategy** that responds to market evidence instead of fixed targets.
